Let me remind you (the dream poem)

we’ve to bear what keeps us in mind:
the kindness of a friend who drove

all night to be near, a daughter
practiced in arriving, come in time

to lift mum safe from the last bath,
the pad on the hessian bedside table

with biro lists of gifts, garden tasks
(scored-out), and a plan to end pain

made, made again, but never taken.
The night she left the shock was mes-

meric. I held the bed so’s not to go
out the window. I had to learn dreams:

echelons of silver planes in fingertip
rose through her air, behind where

she was waving on the—uh-oh—crown
of the tallest pine she has to fall from.

Not to worry, it’s my dream:
replay the action—fast-as-dreams-allow—

by the fifth go I’ve prepared a catch-
all nest for her to plummet into.

In her dream the hill she’d chosen
has a hazel whose suckers grew

in knuckle-duster loops and folds,
with an arch we took turns to wriggle

ourselves free of  the muck the bottle-
smashers make. A we do vow to

parley with terror in nature,
as you used to in our future.

Another dream had her forcing
a pitiless swim 8 miles into the bay.

I dreamed lifeguards to fetch her back.
They buried her in a pit of sand

but I made sure they dug her out un-
harmed (it’s my dream) and floated

her in the water, strong arms by her
sides, draped in blades of kelp

and hung with cysts of air to breathe.
The pit is slim (as happiness is)

and—in a dream—becomes the cold
paragraph of sea we dived in

when we dreamt our sea loft in Fife.
That, over there, is the same bit of sea

in my kitchen window, coloring
each lock-down day, adding a gull

on the chimney pot to repeat
how you’d laugh when we’d chant

one-leg, one-leg, cheering, for any
gull’s the one if   it can stand on

one-leg. If  this sun-cure flops,
falling out a window or wading

in the waves—like my blind dog
paddling toward the dim bulb

of  sunset—remain options.
When there’s this pain this often.

I dreamed the dog roped to a car
that’s—oh no—accelerating. So

I dreamed me to leap, cut, leap,
cut it free. Comforting the injury

my dream dog comforted me (muttering):
don’t be so stupid, those drownings

aren’t waves, but a swim to tide in.
It means something like you

can seep your head in water while
I bathe in an oxygen life’s intent on.
